#the current city info) is 1, and i to everything else is 9 (I think that's the
#max pathing distance from any one node to another)
#if the distance from i to j is less than infinity, then check to see J's path
#to every other city (k goes from 1 to 48), and if the distance from (J to I) +
#(I to K) is less than the current distance from J to k
#set the dist of J to K to be that sum.

#SECOND 2d array, this one storing an intermediary; initialize it such that I
#to I = i, i to j (if they're neighbors) = i, and everything else is undefined

#to find distance, use one 2d array; to find direction, use two 2d arrays- one
#to store the distance, one to store the previous location between i and k
#prev(j,k) returns one step on the way from j to k.  if j=k, return k; if k
#neighbors j, then return k.  If neither, call this function on (i, prev(i,k).
